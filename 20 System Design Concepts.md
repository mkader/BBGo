Top 20 System Design Concepts You Should Know

1. Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers for reliability and availability.
2. Caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.
3. Database Sharding: Splits databases to handle large-scale data growth.
4. Replication: Copies data across replicas for availability and fault tolerance.
5. CAP Theorem: Trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
6. Consistent Hashing: Distributes load evenly in dynamic server environments.
7. Message Queues: Decouples services using asynchronous event-driven architecture.
8. Rate Limiting: Controls request frequency to prevent system overload.
9. API Gateway: Centralized entry point for routing API requests.
10. Microservices: Breaks systems into independent, loosely coupled services.
11. Service Discovery: Locates services dynamically in distributed systems.
12. CDN: Delivers content from edge servers for speed.
13. Database Indexing: Speeds up queries by indexing important fields.
14. Data Partitioning: Divides data across nodes for scalability and performance.
15. Eventual Consistency: Guarantees consistency over time in distributed databases
16. WebSockets: Enables bi-directional communication for live updates.
17. Scalability: Increases capacity by upgrading or adding machines.
18. Fault Tolerance: Ensures system availability during hardware/software failures.
19. Monitoring: Tracks metrics and logs to understand system health.
20. Authentication & Authorization: Controls user access and verifies identity securely.
