Check out these 8 tips to boost frontend performance:

1. Compression - Compress files and minimize data size before transmission to reduce network load.

2. Selective Rendering/Windowing - Display only visible elements to optimize rendering performance. For example, in a dynamic list, only render visible items.

3. Modular Architecture with Code Splitting - Split a bigger application bundle into multiple smaller bundles for efficient loading.

4. Priority-Based Loading - Prioritize essential resources and visible (or above-the-fold) content for a better user experience.

5. Pre-loading - Fetch resources in advance before they are requested to improve loading speed.

6. Tree Shaking or Dead Code Removal - Optimize the final JS bundle by removing dead code that will never be used.

7. Pre-fetching - Proactively fetch or cache resources that are likely to be needed soon.

8. Dynamic Imports = Load code modules dynamically based on user actions to optimize the initial loading times.
