* Here are the 8 most commonly used DNS Record Types.
1. A (Address) Record: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. It is one of the most essential records for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

1. CNAME (Canonical Name) Record: Used to alias one domain name to another. Often used for subdomains, pointing them to the main domain while keeping the actual domain name hidden.

1. AAAA Record : Similar to an A record but maps a domain name to an IPv6 address. They are used for websites and services that support the IPv6 protocol.

1. PTR Record: Provides reverse DNS lookup, mapping an IP address back to a domain name. It is commonly used in verifying the authenticity of a server.
 
1. MX Record: Directs email traffic to the correct mail server.
  
1. NS (Name Server) Record: Specifies the authoritative DNS servers for the domain. These records help direct queries to the correct DNS servers for further lookups.

1. SRV (Service) Record: SRV record specifies a host and port for specific services such as VoIP. They are used in conjunction with A records.

1. TXT (Text) Record: Allows the administrator to add human-readable text to the DNS records. It is used to include verification records, like SPF, for email security.
