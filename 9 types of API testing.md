1. Smoke Testing: This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks.

1. Functional Testing: This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results.

1. Integration Testing: This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested.

1. Regression Testing: This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn’t break the existing behaviors of APIs.

1. Load Testing: This tests applications’ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application.

1. Stress Testing: We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally.

1. Security Testing: This tests the APIs against all possible external threats.

1. UI Testing: This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly.

1. Fuzz Testing: This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.
