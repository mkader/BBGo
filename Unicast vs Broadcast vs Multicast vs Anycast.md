* These are 4 network communication methods you must know.
  1. Unicast : Unique sender and a single receiver. For example, communication between two people in a party. Used in protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
  1. Broadcast: Single sender and multiple receivers. For example, a person at a party stands up on a podium and shouts a message to everyone. However, it doesnâ€™t mean that every receiver gets the message. Used in Address Resolution Protocol, DHCP, and NTP
  1. Multicast: Sender to a specific group of devices in a network. This is a specialized case of broadcast routing. For example, a member of the group talks and listens to other members of the group within a party. Used in IPTV and video conference applications.
  1. Anycast: Sender to a single device or a specific group of devices. For example, saying thank you to one host out of a group of hosts organizing a party. All other hosts also expected to receive the thank you note. Used in DNS querying and CDNs.
