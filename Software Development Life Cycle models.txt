## The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that outlines the process of developing software in a systematic way. Here are some of the most common ones:
* Waterfall Model:
    1. A linear and sequential approach.
    1. Divides the project into distinct phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.

* Agile Model:
    1. Development is done in small, manageable increments called sprints.
    1. Common Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).

* V-Model (Validation and Verification Model):
    1. An extension of the Waterfall model.
    2. Each development phase is associated with a testing phase, forming a V shape.

* Iterative Model:
    1. Focuses on building a system incrementally.
    1. Each iteration builds upon the previous one until the final product is achieved.

* Spiral Model:
    1. Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the Waterfall model.
    1. Each cycle involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

* Big Bang Model:
    1. All coding is done with minimal planning, and the entire software is integrated and tested at once.

* RAD Model (Rapid Application Development):
    1. Emphasizes rapid prototyping and quick feedback.
    1. Focuses on quick development and delivery.

* Incremental Model:
    1. The product is designed, implemented, and tested incrementally until the product is finished.
