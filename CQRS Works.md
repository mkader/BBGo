CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates write (Command) and read (Query) operations for better scalability and maintainability.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1 - The client sends a command to update the system state. A Command Handler validates and executes logic using the Domain Model.

2 - Changes are saved in the Write Database and can also be saved to an Event Store. Events are emitted to update the Read Model asynchronously.

3 - The projections are stored in the Read Database. This database is eventually consistent with the Write Database.

4 - On the query side, the client sends a query to retrieve data.

5 - A Query Handler fetches data from the Read Database, which contains precomputed projections.

6 - Results are returned to the client without hitting the write model or the write database.
