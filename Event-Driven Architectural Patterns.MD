## Event-Driven Architectural (EDA) Patterns
* EDA is a software design approach emphasizing the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. In this architecture, events are state changes or updates within a system. 
* EDA can decouple services, enhance scalability, and improve responsiveness. 
* By allowing systems to react to events asynchronously, EDA supports real-time processing and enables systems to handle high volumes of data efficiently. 
    1. This approach is useful in distributed systems and microservices architectures, where different components must operate independently yet cohesively.
* Significant advantages such as:
    1. Improved fault tolerance because systems can continue operating even if some components fail. 
    1. Better resource utilization by enabling services to scale independently based on demand. 
    1. Supports dynamic and flexible workflows, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing requirements and market conditions.
