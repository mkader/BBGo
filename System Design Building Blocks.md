* These are divided into 6 broad categories
  1. Distributed Computing
    * Distributed message queues facilitate async communication and decouple services
    * Distributed caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory
    * A Distributed task scheduler manages and coordinates the execution of tasks

  1. Scalability and Performance
    * Scaling services help adjust the capacity of services to handle changes in demand
    * CDNs serve content from geographically closer locations to improve performance and reduce latency.
    * Consistent hashing minimizes the remapping of keys when nodes are added or removed

  1. Service Management
    * Service discovery enables services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding network locations

  1. Networking and Communication
    * DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses
    * Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers
    * API Gateway acts as a single entry point for a group of microservices

  1. Data Storage and Management
    * Databases store and manage structured data
    * Object storage helps store complex objects like images, videos, and documents
    * Sharding helps horizontally partition data across multiple nodes
    * Replication helps horizontally scale the database by copying data to multiple nodes

  1. Observability and Resiliency
    * Gain insights into the system's internal state through metrics, logging, and tracing.
