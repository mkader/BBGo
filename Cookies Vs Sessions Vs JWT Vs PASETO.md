* Authentication ensures that only authorized users gain access to an application’s resources. It answers the question of the user’s identity i.e. “Who are you?”

* The modern authentication landscape has multiple approaches: Cookies, Sessions, JWTs, and PASETO. Here’s what they mean:

1. Cookies and Sessions
  * Cookies and sessions are authentication mechanisms where session data is stored on the server and referenced via a client-side cookie.
  * Sessions are ideal for applications requiring strict server-side control over user data. On the downside, sessions may face scalability challenges in distributed systems.

1. JWT
  * JSON Web Token (JWT) is a stateless, self-contained authentication method that stores all user data within the token.
  * JWTs are highly scalable but require careful handling to mitigate the chances of token theft and manage token expiration.

1. PASETO
  * Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens or PASETO improve upon JWT by enforcing stronger cryptographic defaults and eliminating algorithmic vulnerabilities.
  * PASETO simplifies token implementation by avoiding the risks associated with misconfiguration.
